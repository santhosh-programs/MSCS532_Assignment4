# MSCS532_Assignment3

For all the files, I have added the main function. They already have code to test the implemented functions with a random sample data. 
If you need to test various different outputs, you can do by changing the list implemented or create a new list and pass it as a parameter. 

All explanations and detailed analysis will be submitted in a word document
